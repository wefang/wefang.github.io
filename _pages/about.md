I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biomeidical Engineering and Center for Epigenetics at Johns Hopkins University. Currently, I am a member of the [Reza Kalhor lab](https://kalhorlab.bme.jhu.edu). Previously, I did my PhD in the [Honagkai Ji Lab](https://jilab.org). My research interests include genomics, lineage tracing, Bayesian model and deep learning. Recently, I'm also learning about genetics and molecular biology.

Outside of research, I like playing with my dog, playing games, watching and playing basketball.
