I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biomeidical Engineering and Center for Epigenetics at Johns Hopkins University. Currently, I am a member of the [Reza Kalhor lab](https://kalhorlab.bme.jhu.edu). Previously, I did my PhD in the [Honagkai Ji Lab](https://jilab.org). My research interests include lineage tracing, single cell genomics, developmental biology, Bayesian models and deep learning. Recently, I also enjoy learning about genetics and molecular biology.
