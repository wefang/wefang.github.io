I am a member of the [Kalhor lab](kalhorlab.bme.jhu.edu). Previously, I finished my PhD in the [Honagkai Ji Lab](jilab.org) focusing on integrative genomics. My projects included deep learning modelling, comparative genomics and . My research interests include genomics, lineage tracing, somatic mutation, Bayesian model and deep learning. Recently, I'm also learning about genetics and molecular biology.

Outside of research, I like playing games and playing and watching basketball.
