I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biomeidical Engineering and Center for Epigenetics at Johns Hopkins University. Currently, I am a member of the [Reza Kalhor lab](https://kalhorlab.bme.jhu.edu). Previously, I did my PhD in the [Honagkai Ji Lab](https://jilab.org).

### My research includes:
1. Methodologies for reconstructing cell fate histories using lineage barcodes.
2. Methodologies for inferring single cell phylogenies.
3. Model for bridging single cell state and fate readouts in development.
4. Single-cell genomics, deep learning models for integrating different data modalities.
5. Epigenomics and evolution, transferring animal model findings to human.

### My long-term interest is in:
1.  Building statistical and computational methodologies for drawing insights from genomics data. I believe that models we use should allow us to gain mechanistic and causal understanding of biology.
2.  Understanding dynamical process of differentiation and morphogenesis in development, as well as sources and mechanisms of developmental disorders.
