  abstract = {Evolutionary conservation is crucial for understanding genome functions and lays the foundation for using animal models in studying human diseases. However, conventional conservation scores based on DNA sequence evolution do not capture the dynamic biochemical activities of DNA elements, termed functional conservation. Quantifying functional conservation has been limited by the availability of functional genomic data matched across species. To address this, we developed FUNCODE, a framework for characterizing functional conservation through in silico sample matching. Applying FUNCODE to 2,595 uniformly processed datasets from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), we generated genome-wide FUNCODE scores for human and mouse regulatory elements, identifying 3.3 million functionally conserved human-mouse element pairs. We demonstrate FUNCODE{\textquoteright}s diverse applications, including annotating 78,501 novel regulatory elements, transferring 37,968 high-resolution human ENCODE Hi-C loops in immune lineages to mice, identifying conserved functional signals for disease modeling, and enhancing cross-species integration of single-cell omics data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Identifying and functionally characterizing causal disease variants in genome-wide association studies remains a pressing challenge. Here, we construct a consensus variant-to-function (cV2F) score that assigns a single value to each common single-nucleotide variant in the genome, and helps to predict and characterize causal disease variants. The cV2F score leverages features reflecting variant-level experimentally and computationally predicted function (e.g. allelic imbalance and sequence-based deep learning models) and element-level function (e.g. predicted enhancers), and learns optimal combinations of features by training a gradient boosting model on GWAS fine-mapping results. The cV2F-annotated variants attained an AUPRC of 0.822 at identifying held-out fine-mapped variants. Variants with high cV2F scores are highly enriched for heritability (14.2x, s.e. 0.5) across 66 diseases/traits, are uniquely informative for disease heritability, and are highly predictive of variants implicated by reporter assays; cV2F substantially outperforms previous variant-to-function scores using all of these metrics. GWAS fine-mapping of 110 diseases/traits informed by cV2F identified 14.3\% more confidently fine-mapped (PIP \&gt; 0.95) variants than non-functionally informed fine-mapping. We further constructed tissue/cell line-specific cV2F scores that prioritize variants based on regulatory potential in specific tissues/cell lines, attaining high heritability enrichment for tissue-related diseases/traits (15.6x, s.e. 2.3) while providing independent information (average correlation of 0.27 with the primary cV2F score). We highlight examples of GWAS loci for which cV2F pinpoints causal variants with high confidence and elucidates their functional role.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Identifying the key molecular pathways that enable metastasis by analyzing the eventual metastatic tumor is challenging because the state of the founder subclone likely changes following metastatic colonization. To address this challenge, we labeled primary mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) subclones with DNA barcodes to characterize their pre-metastatic state using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq and determine their relative in vivo metastatic potential prospectively. We identified a gene signature separating metastasis-high and metastasis-low subclones orthogonal to the normal-to-PDAC and classical-to-basal axes. The metastasis-high subclones feature activation of IL-1 pathway genes and high NF-κB and Zeb/Snail family activity and the metastasis-low subclones feature activation of neuroendocrine, motility, and Wnt pathway genes and high CDX2 and HOXA13 activity. In a functional screen, we validated novel mediators of PDAC metastasis in the IL-1 pathway, including the NF-κB targets Fos and Il23a, and beyond the IL-1 pathway including Myo1b and Tmem40. We scored human PDAC tumors for our signature of metastatic potential from mouse and found that metastases have higher scores than primary tumors. Moreover, primary tumors with higher scores are associated with worse prognosis. We also found that our metastatic potential signature is enriched in other human carcinomas, suggesting that it is conserved across epithelial malignancies. This work establishes a strategy for linking cancer cell state to future behavior, reveals novel functional regulators of PDAC metastasis, and establishes a method for scoring human carcinomas based on metastatic potential.Competing Interest StatementJ.H. and R.K. are listed as co-inventors on a provisional patent on the use of this studies finding for clinical diagnoses.
